# Reversi

Reversi is a board game involving two players who take turns placing a single piece. Players control squares they have tiles placed on and can reoccupy squares by placing two pieces so that a contiguous set of opposing tiles are bookended by two of their pieces. The game is over when no moves are available and the winner is determined by the player with more tiles at the end of the game. This repository also has a [blog post](https://taylorkemp.github.io./jekyll/update/2018/08/22/Game-Trees-And-Reversi.html) where you can learn more about the design of the AI used in playing this game.
